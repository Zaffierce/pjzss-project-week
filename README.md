# pjzss-project-week
201 Project Week for team PJZZS.  
## README

Our Project is a web-app designed for Seattle users to prepare for EarthQuake disaster.

<br>
All Users will be able to identify Emergency Hub Locations in the area, and to properly prepare their households with enough food to survive a food-shortage, based on the bridge and port dependancy of Seattle.

Strategy for Making Sure Voices are Heard (within a safe environment) 

Three a day check-in meetings: 

Morning meeting - 9am start time – debrief and prep for day  

After lunch – 1pm start time – review the morning, re-check in, and brainstorm as needed for afternoon. 

Before leaving for the day – 5:30pm? How the morning and afternoon went 

General Guidelines: 

Code review occurs at each meetups 

Be patient and kind with each other. 

Suggestion: Start sentences with “I need...”  

There are no bad ideas 

Failure will happen and it’s okay! We do this thing together.  

 

If we’re moving too fast: 

Person who is slower - speak up! Fast coders can slow down.  

Person who is coding fast may need to take a break and help person catch up.
