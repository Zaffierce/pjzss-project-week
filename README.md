# pjzss-project-week
201 Project Week for team PJZZS.  
## README

Our Project is a web-app designed for Seattle users to prepare for EarthQuake disaster.

<br>
All Users will be able to identify Emergency Hub Locations in the area, and to properly prepare their households with enough food to survive a food-shortage, based on the bridge and port dependancy of Seattle.

## Communication Plan 

Communication Formats After Hours and On Weekend: 
* Slack  
* Trello for file sharing, To Do lists 

Communication in the code: 
* Go way overkill on the comments. Comment at every single line getting started.    

Group Working Hours 
* 9am – 6pm group time 
* 8am- 9:15pm be aware group member(s) may need to communicate after group time

Strategy for Making Sure Voices are Heard (within a safe environment) 
* Three a day check-in meetings
* Morning meeting - 9am start time – debrief, code review and prep for day  
* After lunch – 1pm start time – review the morning, re-check in, and brainstorm as needed for afternoon. 
* Before leaving for the day – 5:30pm? How the morning and afternoon went 

General Guidelines: 
* Code review occurs at each meetups 
* Be patient and kind with each other. 
* Suggestion: Start sentences with “I need...”  
* There are no bad ideas 
* Failure will happen and it’s okay! We do this thing together.  

If we’re moving too fast: 
* Person who is slower - speak up! Fast coders can slow down.  
* Person who is coding fast may need to take a break and help person catch up.  

## Conflict Resolution Plan
Process to resolve conflicts
1. Everyone stops coding 
2. Return to communication ground rules.  
3. Try to understand the conflict 
4. Come to mutual agreement without taking sides 
5. Find a compromise between the two intersecting viewpoints 
6. Discuss things and find happy place 
7. When conflict is resolved, mandatory 10 minute break to relax.  
 
 How to raise concerns to members not adequately contributing 

* First step: Find out why the person is falling behind, without judgement.  
* Put out the invitation to share - if something else outside of project is going on, preventing the person from being present, etc.  
* During briefs in morning, check in with each other with how they’re doing with a task. 
* Honesty from each of us about assigned tasks.  
* Ask for help when needed.  
 

How and when to escalate conflict when attempts are unsuccessful: 
* If person is unwilling to talk through or unwilling to improve. They may be going through the motions, but not contributing, not willing to work on issue, and not willing to reach out.  
* Escalation will involve reaching out to Boss and HR (Lena and Ron).
