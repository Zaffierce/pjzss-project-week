# pjzss-project-week
201 Project Week for team PJZZS.  
## README

Our Project is a web-app designed for Seattle users to prepare for EarthQuake disaster.

<br>
All Users will be able to identify Emergency Hub Locations in the area, and to properly prepare their households with enough food to survive a food-shortage, based on the bridge and port dependancy of Seattle.
