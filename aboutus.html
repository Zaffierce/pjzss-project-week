                <div class="text">My name is Jon Veach and I am a 29 year old IT professional and software developer who has spent the last 9 years of his life serving in the U.S. Navy. He lived in Japan for 6 years but can barely speak or read Japanese! In his free time,
                    he can be found off-roading in his Suzuki Jimny or at home, developing software. My goal after completing my schooling is to get a job in Tokyo.</div>

                <div class="text">My name is Peter Carmichael and I am 26 year old software developer. Before changing careers I was a chef for the past 11 years. I hope to get a job in the area after completing Code Fellows working on UX. My main hobbies include; building
                    large lego displays for conventions, working on my old Land Rover, and doing fun stuff outside when the weather is nice.</div>

                    (URMs) in Seattle, monitor her elevation in case of a tsunami, and stash food like a squirrel in case the world ends.</div>

                    I'm not busy learning, I can be found cuddling my three cats, crocheting, and watching Star Trek with my husband.</div>

                    in my family in 2 generations to truly have a trade-related career on my shoulders. I hope one day to take all of what I've learned, and be able to teach it to those around me, as well as the younger generation.</div>
