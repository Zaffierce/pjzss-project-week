## City of Seattle
* The City of Seattle is concerned for the resident's safety. As the potential for earthquakes grows, the need to have safety measures in place grows evermore. It is important to have resources available for the public, which will direct residents to Emergency Hub locations located around the city, where they can meet in case of emergencies.
Being a shore-line City, it is also important that the citizens have an idea of how best to prepare themselves/their household for potential disaster, by having enough food resources in case of port, or highway blockage. This web-app will enable the identification of Emergency Hub locations, as well as calculate the necessary food their family should have in preperation for food shortages.

## Emergency Hub
* As an Emergency Hub location for my community, I want to be sure that local residents know where to meet in the case of a disaster, such as an earthquake. I worry that residents do not know where I am, and how to find me. 
This app allows residents to discover me, and find which Hub is closest to them, as well as to better map-out their local area for disaster preparedness. It also allows them to be better prepared with food items, so that what little food Emergency Hubs have stored, can go out to those in need, so as not to run out of food too quickly.
